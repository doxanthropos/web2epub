# web2epub

## Initial Idea
Not really ready to start creating this, but I want to note the idea:
I like to read stuff in my e-book reader. So I would really like to have the webpages (blogposts, articles, whatever) that I want to read on one day to be accessable in that.
My idea is to have a program that takes a list of urls or a folder of html documents and compiles them into one epub.
## Someone already created it
While I did nothing with this idea someone else was able to actually create what I had in mind:
